# Kaggle_Nile

# Problem statement

Every week from late spring through the fall, mosquitos in traps across the city of Chicago are tested for the nile virus. The results of these tests influence when and where the city will spray airborne pesticides to control adult mosquito populations.

Given weather, location, testing, and spraying data, we will predict when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for West Nile virus. A more accurate method of predicting outbreaks of West Nile virus in mosquitos will help the City of Chicago and CPHD more efficiently and effectively allocate resources towards preventing transmission of this potentially deadly virus. 

# Goals and success criteria

Given weather,location,testing and spraying data we want to predict the presence of West Nile Virus (WNV).
We will try to produce a model for which the AUC of the ROC curve is better than 0.5, by cross validating the train database.
